# create a fully featured blocks game that uses python 3 make a good gui game not terminal game and arrows should control  movement and aim the game and space to fire or can use mouse give options that can be selected from a menuand auto pause game while in menu and allow checkpoints to be saved and lkoaded for game levels
from turtle import Screen, Turtle
import time
screen = Screen()
screen.tracer(0)  # turn off the drawing as this helps to make it seem like its running faster than normal and that way you will not have to worry about lagging your game or having a hard time getting things done during sessions of playing different level games use a game engine like unity that provides an interface for programmers to create their own games using code programming languages

# Create a custom made functions variables methods attributes and properties for the object below this is how to do it though there may be other ways of doing it also this way will hopefully allow you to get a better understanding of what each part does without having to spend time figuring it out on your own thanks again so im still working my way through the code in order that everything gets done as soon and possible as fast as possible but please do not forget that at some point you will likely want to change something or delete anything from this program.

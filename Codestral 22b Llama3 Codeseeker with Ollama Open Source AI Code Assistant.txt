Visual Studio Code supports ARM-based devices and can be installed on Raspberry Pi OS. You can download the ARM version of VS Code from the official VS Code website.
Download and Install VS Code:

Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the following commands to download and install VS 


sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wget gpg
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=armhf] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y code


Launch Visual Studio Code:

code --install-extension ms-python.python

or

Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

ext install ex3ndr.llama-coder




You can start Visual Studio Code from the terminal by typing code or by finding it in your application menu.
Install Extensions:

Once Visual Studio Code is running, you can install extensions through the Extensions view (accessible from the sidebar or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X).
Search for the extension you need (such as "Python", "C/C++", or "Remote - SSH") and click Install.
Recommended Extensions for ARM-based Raspberry Pi:
Python:

For Python development, install the Python extension by Microsoft.
C/C++:

For C/C++ development, install the C/C++ extension by Microsoft.
Remote - SSH:

If you need to work on a remote machine, the Remote - SSH extension allows you to open a remote folder on any remote machine with SSH access.
GitLens:

For enhanced Git capabilities, consider the GitLens extension.
Docker:

If you are using Docker, the Docker extension can help manage your Docker containers and images.
